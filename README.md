# mxene project
Analyzing how entropy-driven aggregation drives phase separation in mxene-polymer systems

## ⚙️ Installation

Run the following in your terminal:

# bash/zsh
`git clone git@github.com:eridanirojas/mxene.git`

# then navigate into mxene
`cd mxene`

# Create the conda environment
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

# Activate the environment
`conda activate mxene`

# If GPU compatible version required of hoomd, run
`conda install -c conda-forge "hoomd=*=gpu*"`

# Launch Jupyter, run

`jupyter notebook`


Then, in order to run a small scale simulation, navigate to the sims/ directory:

- Onboarding.ipynb = current working simulation you should use, shrink step is included allowing system to be packed loosely then shrunk to be dense, causing more interactions to occur
- clean_sim_with_randomwalk.ipynb = a future notebook, has a shrink step but also manipulates the geometry of the chains is randomly set so that we may set a dihedral to be something other than zero

To analyze results, navigate to working_example/:

- clustering_plots.ipynb = we use this to determine the magnitude of clustering over time in a simulation. this means both size and amount of clusters, also using independent samples
- TPSvsN.ipynb = useful notebook for determining relationship between system size and timesteps per second, not included in the main workflow at the moment

In order to run a large scale simulation, navigate to signac/:

- submit.sh = running `sbatch submit.sh` will run sim_with_shrink.py as it currently is, with the configurations present in this file.
- sim_with_shrink.py = simulation file specifically made for running on cluster
